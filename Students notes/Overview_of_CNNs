Image Classification Problem.


Algorithm looks at an image, then lables from a pool.
Other Visual REcognition problems.

Object Detection: 
    Bounding boxes where objects are.

Image Captioning.
    System needs to produce a natural language description.

Reused techniques. (CNN) - Convnets

Jeff H. Toronto.
Seven layer Convolution Network (AlexNet)

Trend is getting deeper and deeper.
Residual network 152 layers.

Tunning & Tweaking this algorithms.
Dive deep in how models work.

Important: breakthrough moment 2012.
But, were not invented then.

1998 foundational work. Lecun (BellLabs)
Recognize digits.

Recognize HandWritten checks, address (Post Office).
Structure is similar to AlexNet.

Raw pixels. Fully Connected layers.
Two pictures are similar.

Why popular in last years?
1. Computation: Moore's Law.
1998 -> 2012 10**6 transitors => 10**9 + GPUs
Larger Architectures. Just increase models size.

2. Data.
Algorithms hungry for data. Fwed them.
Pixels used in training: 10**7 => 10**14

Build machines that can see as people.
More than clasifying objects.
Open challenges, more ambitious projects.

Semantic Segmentation. 
3D Understanding, reconstrunctiong world.

Activity recognition: Video.
Augmented Reality & new type of sensors.

CApture intrincancies in real world.
Semantic related objects.

Representation as a tree, richness of the world.
Visual system can do.

Flash image.
Rapid exposure, long descripting paragraphs.
From external knowledge.
Understand history of an image.

Understanding of image.
Exciting as a researcher.

Computer Vision TEchnology can better our Lives.
Mdical Diagnosis, Self-Driving Cars, Robotics.
